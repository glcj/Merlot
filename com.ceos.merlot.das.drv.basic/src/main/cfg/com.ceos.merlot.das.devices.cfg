#
# . device:      Descriptive name within the control architecture. 
#                Must be unique.

# AS01=s7://192.168.1.23/0/2,simatic,compresor system
# 
# Although there can be a single configuration file for all devices, 
# practice shows that it is recommended to have one configuration file 
# per device.
#
# Example:
# com.ceos.merlot.das.devices-AS01.cfg
