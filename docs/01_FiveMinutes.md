This is a quick introduction to the Merlot functionalities, for which it should not take more than five minutes, including the time to read this text.

## Descargar el programa

Merlot can be downloaded directly from the GitHub pages for windows (.zip) and linux (.tar.gz). The only difference is the execution permissions for the startup scripts.
