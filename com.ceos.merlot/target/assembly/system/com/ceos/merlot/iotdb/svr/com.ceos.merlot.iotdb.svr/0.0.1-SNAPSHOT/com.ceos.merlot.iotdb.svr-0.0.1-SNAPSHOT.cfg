### Dynamic Parameter Adapter Configuration
####################

# Is dynamic parameter adapter enable. It's recommended for users to enable parameter adapter.
# The adapter can dynamically adjust the following two parameters according to the memory load of the system:
# 1. tsfile_size_threshold which is introduced below.
# 2. memtable_size_threshold which is introduced below.
# By dynamically adjusting these two parameters, the probability of system memory explosion is greatly reduced.

# 2. MaxDiskUsableSpaceFirstStrategy: the system will choose the directory whose disk has the maximum space.
# 3. MinFolderOccupiedSpaceFirstStrategy: the system will choose the directory whose folder has the minimum occupied space.
# Set SequenceStrategy,MaxDiskUsableSpaceFirstStrategy and MinFolderOccupiedSpaceFirstStrategy to apply the corresponding strategy.
